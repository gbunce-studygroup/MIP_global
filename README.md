# Mobile Instant Pages Framework (Global)

#### Frontend framework based on the university website framework for creating branded themes for Mobile Instant Pages (MIP) landing pages.

This is the global version and should ONLY be used to compile changes to the `mip_global_grid.css / mip_global_grid.min.css` stylesheets in order to make changes/fixes to all MIP landing pages.

The task for compiling the global css is `grunt mipglobal`. 

After compiling, copy and paste the contents of `mip_global_grid.min.css` to the CSS field located at `Sitecore > Content > Global > Mobile Instant Pages Styles > MIP Global Styles > Styles` then save & publish.

The brand version of this framework has been added to the [University website framework repo](https://github.com/gbunce-studygroup/University_website_framework) inside the `landing_page/MIP` folder.
